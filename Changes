Revision history for Perl module Class::LazyObject

.10_1 3-13 July 2008
	- Fix for inheriting from a class that inherits from Class::LazyObject. (bug 14457)
	  This is not yet a production release because I want to give how we are doing this more thought.
	- Slight change in the licensing terms. Rather than saying 'under the same terms as Perl itself'
	  (which for Perl 5 meant the GPLv2 or later, or the Artistic Licensev1) I now explicitly license
	  under GPLv2 or Artistic v1/v2. As I say in the docs, if this causes you any problems, please
	  let me know.

.10: 21 Feb 2003
	- First released version.
